"""Importing recordings and transcripts from the macOS Voice Memos app.

Voice Memos already transcribes on device, so a memo arrives with the expensive
part done. This module reads the app's library and hands the audio plus its
existing transcript to the rest of the pipeline, skipping Whisper entirely.

Two things shape the implementation:

**The library is protected.** It lives in a group container that needs Full Disk
Access, so the process reading it has to be granted that once in System Settings.

**The schema is Apple's and undocumented.** Column names have changed across
releases, and transcription is recent. Rather than hardcode names that may not
exist on a given macOS version, the tables are introspected and columns matched
by pattern. ``describe_library`` prints what was found, which is the fastest way
to see why an import came back empty.

The database is opened read-only and immutable. Nothing here writes to it.
