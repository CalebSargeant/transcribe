"""Local speaker diarization via sherpa-onnx.

A screen recording gives us one mixed mono track, so speakers have to be
recovered from the audio itself. sherpa-onnx does this with two small ONNX
models (~46 MB total) and no PyTorch: pyannote segmentation finds speech turns,
a TitaNet embedding model gives each turn a voice fingerprint, and those get
clustered into distinct speakers.

Clustering yields anonymous labels ("Speaker 1", "Speaker 2"). Turning those
into real names is a separate, LLM-driven step -- see ``notes.resolve_speaker_names``.
